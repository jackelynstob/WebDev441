# Week 1

### My Workflow

- I began with downloading Michael Cassens' code for his live site. I took a look at it to refresh my brain and dissected each piece.
- After looking through all of the readings and review material he gave us, I began my code.
- To begin my code I followed the flow of Michael's pretty closely, and modifying it to be my own personal and unique design with CSS.

### Troubles
- I had trouble with using a completely unique code of mine - for the assignment Michael gave us, a lot of what he had was what I wanted to have in mine as well, so I used pieces of his.
- After learning this about myself, I want to start projects off on my own, with my own design before looking at other's material.
- At the beginning of this week I was fairly confused with what breakpoints were even after the readings, but after messing around with them *a lot*, I figured the right dimensions to use based off my Mac.
- Responsive Web Design is going to be especially confusing for me to grasp with having to begin small and work outward, but I'm excited to learn how to conquer it to make my work more relevant to the current times.
- I'm having a hard time pushing my changes to github... it says my files are too big!!!
- At times I wished to rearrange my page layout, but when that happened my dimension became wonky and my page didn't look like how I'd like it to:
(Desired look):

But if I tried to make my tabs at the top be at the bottom of the "Jackelyn" it didn't turn out correctly:

I know this means I just needed to work with the dimensions, but I lost interest in fiddling with the numbers.
- The "vh" function is still a little confusing for me, but it worked with Michael's code and when I tried to use percentages or 'em' it didn't work as well and I think this is because it uses the dimensions of the viewport. An example of my code using it looks like this:  <br/>
```.description-container {
    min-height: 50vh;
    font-size: 150%;
  ```

### Conclusions
- I'm very fortunate for this week being a review, and I'm very happy Michael Cassens works through videos with us. Our last Web Design class was a little aggravating & I'm for-seeing this class to be one we will actually learn something useful in!!!
