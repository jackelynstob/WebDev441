# HW11

This homework was pretty hard for me. I think without the walkthrough I was a little lost. I really loved that we could work along with it, but when I got stuck on a step and tried to move on I couldn't. Usually when we have the homework video walkthrough if I get stuck on a step I can see what you're doing and figure out where to go from there but without it I spent a lot of time trying to figure out things that normally shouldn't have been that hard. I do understand you are setting us up to be able to debug and problem solve ourselves but I feel like I still need to learn just a bit more before I can be set *this* free if that makes any sense. I'm grateful for all of your help on working on my code for me and cleaning it up/seeing where I went wrong. I also think if this class was taught in-person it'd be a lot quicker to digest the knowledge :)

Thank you!!!
